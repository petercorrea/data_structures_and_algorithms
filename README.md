## ðŸ”¨ Scripts

#### Install Dev Dependencies

```
npm i
```

#### Test

```
npm test
```

#### Spell Check

This script will find all incorrect spellings and **whitelist** them.

Manually review the words in cspell.txt. If the word is indeed correct leave it in the list, otherwise correct it in the codebase and remove it from the list.

```
npm run spell-check
```

#### Clean

This script will lint, format, spell check and test code without being part of the pre-commit hook.

```
npm run clean
```

### Pre Commit Hooks

The Pre-commit hook will lint, format, spell check and test code.
